# Js learning journey

This repository is where I gather my first front-end projects, showcasing my journey from working with Vanilla JavaScript to exploring React.js. Each project reflects the learning process and experimentation with different technologies and tools, including JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and React, as well as modern build tools like Vite. These projects are stepping stones in my development path, highlighting key skills in DOM manipulation, state management, and creating dynamic user interfaces.
